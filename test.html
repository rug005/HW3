        Another one of my favorite hobbies is hiking. My favorite thing about hikes is that it allows me to be grounded with nature. I joineded the hiking club in 2022 at UCSD. The hiking club enabled me to gain a better understanding the world since I was able to meet a great amount of people from different places and backgrounds.  </center> </black-text>
